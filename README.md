# LootHoarders

LootHoarders is a game project developed in C# using the Unity game engine. It is a clone of the Dead Man's Draw game, with the primary goal of practicing and implementing the best code structure using a combination of MVC (Model-View-Controller) and ECS (Entity-Component-System) architecture, along with clean architecture principles.

## Goals

- Practice writing the best code structure using MVC and ECS architecture.

- Implement clean architecture principles.

- Add new game mechanics to expand upon the core gameplay of Dead Man's Draw and enhance the overall experience of LootHoarders.

- Release the game on stores.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have any ideas for new game mechanics, improvements to the code structure, or any other suggestions, feel free to contribute to the project.
